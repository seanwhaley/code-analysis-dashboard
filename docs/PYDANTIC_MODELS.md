# Pydantic Model Analysis Documentation

**Last Updated:** 2025-01-27 15:30:00

## Overview

This dashboard provides comprehensive analysis and visualization of Pydantic models
in your codebase, enabling developers to understand data model architecture,
relationships, and usage patterns.

## Key Features

### Model Detection and Classification

- **Automatic Detection**: Identifies all Pydantic models through AST analysis
- **Type Classification**: Distinguishes between BaseModel, Form models, Config models
- **Inheritance Tracking**: Maps complete inheritance hierarchies
- **Field Composition**: Analyzes which models use other models as field types

### Visualization Capabilities

- **Inheritance Diagrams**: Interactive hierarchy visualizations using Mermaid
- **Composition Graphs**: Field relationship mapping between models
- **Network Views**: D3.js powered interactive relationship graphs
- **Statistics Dashboard**: Usage metrics and complexity analysis

### Analysis Insights

- **Field Analysis**: Type annotations, default values, validation rules
- **Validator Detection**: Custom field and model validators
- **Configuration Tracking**: Model config settings and customizations
- **Usage Patterns**: Where models are imported and used

## Technical Implementation

### Data Collection

All model information is extracted via Python AST analysis during database population:

- Class definitions and inheritance
- Field definitions with type annotations
- Validator methods and decorators
- Import statements and dependencies

### Visualization Integration

- **Mermaid Diagrams**: Server-side rendered inheritance trees
- **D3.js Networks**: Client-side interactive relationship graphs
- **Panel Components**: Reactive UI elements for filtering and exploration
- **Export Capabilities**: SVG download and data export functionality

## Developer Benefits

- **Architecture Understanding**: Visualize data model relationships
- **Refactoring Support**: Identify model dependencies before changes
- **Documentation**: Auto-generated model relationship documentation
- **Code Quality**: Identify overly complex or poorly structured models
