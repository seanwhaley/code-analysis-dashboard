## ‚ö†Ô∏è **Mermaid Limitations Identified**

### Current Issues with Mermaid:

1. **Limited Interactivity**: No click handlers, hover effects, or dynamic updates
2. **Rendering Reliability**: Frequent initialization failures and syntax errors
3. **Performance**: Slow rendering with large datasets
4. **Customization**: Limited styling and layout control
5. **Complex Data**: Struggles with hierarchical or multi-dimensional relationships
6. **Browser Compatibility**: Inconsistent behavior across different browsers
7. **Error Handling**: Poor error messages and recovery mechanisms

### Specific Problems in Our Dashboard:

- **Class Inheritance**: Simple tree structures don't show complex inheritance patterns well
- **Import Dependencies**: Network graphs are too simplistic for real dependency analysis
- **Function Relationships**: Can't show call graphs or parameter flows effectively
- **Dynamic Updates**: Can't update diagrams without full re-render
- **User Interaction**: No way to filter, zoom, or explore data interactively

## üöÄ **Recommended Visualization Library Alternatives**

2. **Test**: Compare user experience between Mermaid and D3.js versions
3. **Migrate**: Gradually replace Mermaid diagrams with more appropriate libraries
4. **Enhance**: Add interactivity and advanced features not possible with Mermaid
